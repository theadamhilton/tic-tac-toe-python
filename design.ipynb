    "## First Principles Thinking\n",
    "1. Identify and state the traditional assumption of something\n",
    "2. Deconstruction: Break a problem or concept into its simplest components, \n",
    "stripping away assumptions and preconceived notions\n",
    "3. Fundamental Truths: Identify what is undeniably true about the components-\n",
    "these are the \"first principles\"\n",
    "4. Reconstruction: Use these first principles as the building blocks to create \n",
    "innovative solutions or make better decisions'''\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Let's apply first principles thinking to building an electric car:\n",
    "- Traditional Assumption: \"Batteries are expensive, so electric cars will always \n",
    "be costly.\"\n",
    "- Deconstruction: What makes batteries expensive? Their materials (e.g., cobalt, lithium) \n",
    "and manufacturing processes\n",
    "- Fundamental Truths: Batteries store energy through chemical reactions, and alternative \n",
    "materials or methods might achieve the same goal.\n",
    "- Reconstruction: This leads to exploring new technologies like solid-state batteries or \n",
    "reducing reliance on rare materials, which can make electric cars cheaper and more efficient'''\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tic-Tac-Toe:\n",
    "- **Traditional Assumption**: \"Well, if I want to make Tic-Tac-Toe then I'll need a 3 x 3 board \n",
    "of some sort.\"\n",
    "- **Deconstruction**: How does Tic-Tac-Toe work? With logic or algorithms\n",
    "- **Fundamental Truths**: Players take turns placing their 3 allotted marks (X or O) in a \n",
    "continuous line, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally\n",
    "- **Reconstruction**: Using algorithms with best practices, we can identify the turn player, \n",
    "control the state of the game and determine a winner or tie result"
